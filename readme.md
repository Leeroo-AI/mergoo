`mergoo` is a library for easily merging multiple LLM experts, and efficiently train the merged LLM. With `mergoo`, you can efficiently integrate the knowledge of different generic or domain-based LLM experts.

## Installation
Install by pip:
```
pip install mergoo
```
Install latest unstable version on Github:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/Leeroo-AI/mergoo
```
Install it from the source:
```
git clone https://github.com/Leeroo-AI/mergoo
cd mergoo
pip install -e .
``` 

## Quick Start
### Configuration Setup
Specify the config for merging:  
- ```model_type```: type of base model. choices: ```mistral```, ```llama```, or ```bert```.
- ```num_experts_per_token```: Number of experts for each token of MoE.
- ```experts```: config for experts to merge. includes ```expert_name``` and Hugging Face ü§ó```model_id```.
- ```router_layers```: layers chosen for applying Mixture-of-Experts.

#### Fully Fine-tuned Experts
This is a sample config when merging **fully** fine-tuned LLM experts. 
```python
config = {
    "model_type": "mistral",
    "num_experts_per_tok": 2,
    "experts": [
        {"expert_name": "base_expert", "model_id": "mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1"},
        {"expert_name": "expert_1", "model_id": "meta-math/MetaMath-Mistral-7B"},
        {"expert_name": "expert_2", "model_id": "ajibawa-2023/Code-Mistral-7B"}
    ],
    "router_layers": ["gate_proj", "up_proj", "down_proj"]
}
```
For the above example, we merged math and code mistral-based experts. Please refer to [this notebook](https://github.com/Leeroo-AI/mergoo/blob/main/notebooks/llama_compose_trainer.ipynb) for further details!

#### Mixture of Adapters (MoE on LoRA)
This is a sample config when merging **LoRA** fine-tuned LLM experts. ```mergoo``` builds a routing layer on top of LoRAs, resulting in a **mixture of adapters**.
```python
config = {
    "model_type": "mistral",
    "num_experts_per_tok": 2,
    "base_model": "mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1",
    "experts": [
        {"expert_name": "adapter_1", "model_id": "predibase/customer_support"},
        {"expert_name": "adapter_2", "model_id": "predibase/customer_support_accounts"},
        {"expert_name": "adapter_3", "model_id": "predibase/customer_support_orders"},
        {"expert_name": "adapter_4", "model_id": "predibase/customer_support_payments"}
    ],
}
```
The ```expert_name``` starts with ```adapter``` instead of ```expert```. Please refer to [this notebook](https://github.com/Leeroo-AI/mergoo/blob/main/notebooks/Mistral_lora_compose_trainer.ipynb) for further details!

### Merge Experts 
Following the config setup, ```mergoo``` creates the merged LLM as:
```python
import torch
from mergoo.compose_experts import ComposeExperts

# create checkpoint
model_id = "data/mistral_lora_moe"
expertmerger = ComposeExperts(config, torch_dtype=torch.float16)
expertmerger.compose()
expertmerger.save_checkpoint(model_id)
```

### Load / Finetune Merged Expert
Now, you can easily train the merged LLM with Hugging Face Trainer:
```python
from transformers import Trainer
from mergoo.models.modeling_mistral import MistralForCausalLM

model = MistralForCausalLM.from_pretrained("data/mistral_lora_moe") 
# NOTE: 'gate' / router layers are untrained hence weight loading warning would appeare for them

trainer = Trainer( ... )
trainer.train()
```
